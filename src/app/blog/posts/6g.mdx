## About

6G is the upcoming sixth generation of mobile communication technology, expected to succeed 5G around 2030.  
It promises to deliver **extremely high data rates (up to terabits per second)**, **ultra-low latency** in the sub-millisecond range, and **integrated intelligence** powered by AI and machine learning at the network core.  

Beyond faster speeds, 6G will enable immersive technologies such as **extended reality (XR)**, **holographic communications**, **tactile internet**, and **massive IoT connectivity** with enhanced reliability and security.  

## Key Features

- **Ultra-high throughput**: Speeds up to 1 Tbps.  
- **Sub-millisecond latency**: Enabling real-time tactile internet.  
- **Integrated AI**: Self-optimizing and intelligent networks.  
- **Terahertz spectrum**: Opening new frequency bands for extreme capacity.  
- **Ubiquitous coverage**: Leveraging terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (NTNs).  

## Potential Use Cases

- **Holographic communication** for business and entertainment.  
- **Digital twins** for smart cities, factories, and healthcare.  
- **Remote surgery and advanced telemedicine** with guaranteed reliability.  
- **Immersive XR experiences** for education, gaming, and collaboration.  
- **Massive IoT deployments** with billions of connected devices.  

## Research and Development

While 6G is still in early stages, governments, universities, and telecom companies worldwide have launched major R&D initiatives. Standardization efforts are expected to start around **2025**, with the first commercial deployments projected for **2030**.  

Researchers are currently exploring key technologies such as:  
- Terahertz (THz) communication.  
- Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRS).  
- Integration of terrestrial and satellite networks.  
- Quantum communication for enhanced security.
