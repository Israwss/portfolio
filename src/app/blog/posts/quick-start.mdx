## About

Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) refer to communication systems that rely on satellites, high-altitude platforms (HAPS), and other space or aerial infrastructure to extend connectivity beyond the reach of traditional terrestrial networks.  
They are becoming a critical component of 5G and 6G ecosystems, enabling seamless global coverage, secure data transmission, and reliable connectivity in remote, rural, or underserved regions.  

NTNs are not only relevant for everyday mobile communications but also for mission-critical applications such as disaster recovery, maritime and aviation connectivity, military communications, and secure IoT integration.  

## Key Benefits

- **Global Coverage**: Extend mobile connectivity to areas where terrestrial infrastructure is not feasible.  
- **Reliability**: Provide resilient backup in case of terrestrial network outages.  
- **Security**: Enable encrypted, secure channels for sensitive communications.  
- **Future-Ready**: Serve as a foundation for 6G and beyond, supporting ultra-low latency and massive IoT deployments.  

## Use Cases

- **Disaster recovery**: Maintaining communication when ground infrastructure is damaged.  
- **Maritime and aviation**: Connecting ships, aircraft, and passengers worldwide.  
- **Remote industries**: Supporting mining, oil, and research operations in isolated locations.  
- **Defense and security**: Ensuring protected and resilient communications for strategic missions.  

## Quick start

If you are a developer or researcher interested in NTNs, here are some suggested steps:
